# MicroComputerPEM

This is a project from the Program for Excellence in Microelectronics (PEM) that aims to build a SAP-1 (Simple as Possible 1) microprocessor. The objective is to understand the role of the components and blocks involved in a microprocessor system, and to develop skills in using the QUARTUS PRIME 16 tool for the implementation of this type of device.

The microprocessor is capable of performing simple operations such as adding and subtracting, and displaying the result on the outputs. This project is an excellent opportunity to deepen knowledge about microprocessors and to practice using design tools.

## Features
- Implementation of SAP-1 microprocessor
- Addition and subtraction operations
- Display of results on outputs
- Improving knowledge of microprocessors
- Practice using design tools (QUARTUS PRIME 16)

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/DanielSTS/MicroComputerPEM`
2. Open the project in QUARTUS PRIME 16
3. Compile and implement the design on the device of your choice
4. Perform the desired operations and check the results on the outputs.
